# Resume

Hi, I'm Daniel, a software developer with a passion for learning and
problem-solving. I have experience in web development with many technologies.

My main language is Python, but I also used JavaScript, Go, Dart and Cuda in
some projects.

## Here are some of my demo projects:

### [TelegramNotifier](https://github.com/Daniel-March-Portfolio/TelegramNotifier)

One of my favourite projects, that allows you to send prepared messages to your
Telegram chats.

For example, you can send a message to your chat, when your application is
deployed, or notify about progress of some long-running task.

I used Django, DRF and self-written Telegram API to create this project.

### [Text to mp4 convertor](https://github.com/Daniel-March-Portfolio/Text_to_mp4_convertor)

This is a simple web application that converts text to mp4.
I used Django and moviepy to create this project.

### [DemoShop](https://github.com/Daniel-March-Portfolio/DemoShop)

This is a demo store service written using Django, DRF, Stripe and Celery.

### [Algorithms and data structures](ALGORITHMS_AND_DATA_STRUCTURES.md)

### [LeetCode](https://github.com/Daniel-March-Portfolio/LeetCode)
